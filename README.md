This repository holds the PyTorch code and data for the paper: DERC-SinC: decoupling representation and classifier for cell identification from single-cell transcriptomes

1. Run Pretrain.py to start the self-supervised pre-training based network (SinCSLN) for pre-training.
2. Run Train.py to load the pre-trained model and start the multi-expert network (MET) for scRNA identifciation.
